# secret-password-generator

## Description

I built this password generator website in order to further my skills and knowledge on the basics of Javascript. As a beginner coder, I wanted to gain experience building for loops, functions, and if statements along with understanding data strucures such as arrays. Along with this, my password generator is able to return a password based on the user's specifications on length and whether to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. During my experience working on this project, I learned how to arrive to logical solutions through code.

    ```
